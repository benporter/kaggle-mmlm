March Machine Learning Mania Kaggle Competition

===========

Analysis Plan 

First goal: Build out one full end to end naive model
 - End to end means everything from reading in raw data, clean up, model estimation, model prediction, and output file generation
 - Naive model means a very simple, baseline prediction model, such as predict the high seed each time, or the team with the highest average historial winning percentage

Other goals:
 - Collect external data
 - Break up code into logical parts and parameterize, so models can be built independently from additional data collection and will be ready for fresh predictor variables
 - Win $15,000
